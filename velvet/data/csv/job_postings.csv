Today, JACK SPADE has grown to include clothing, small goods and accessories. We’ve remained true to the idea that good design solves a problem with straightforward solutions, using timeless and durable materials.

Jack Spade

","Overview:
JACK SPADE began in 1996 out of a warehouse on Warren Street in New York City. It grew out of the idea that useful items could also be stylish.

Then we thought, why not sell them to people who really use utility bags? The first JACK SPADE bag was sold to a hardware store in 1997. Today, JACK SPADE has grown to include clothing, small goods and accessories. We’ve remained true to the idea that good design solves a problem with straightforward solutions, using timeless and durable materials.

Peter J Solomon Company

","OVERVIEW
Analysts at PJSC are among the best and the brightest university graduates. A formal training program is offered to all financial analysts during the first month of their two year commitment. They work closely with clients and perform financial modeling and valuation analyses.

Because of our entrepreneurial nature, PJSC encourages our analysts to assume increasing levels of responsibility commensurate with their progress.

JOB RESPONSIBILITIES
Analysts work in small deal teams with two or more senior members of the firm to analyze and execute a broad range of transactions. Assignments generally include: mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, strategic advisory, corporate restructurings, fairness opinions, and financings in the capital markets.
